# HTML
So, you want to make websites? You've come to the right place! The first stop on your way to being a web developer is HTML.

# What is HTML?
First things first: HTML is not a programming language. It's what's known as a 'markup language.' That means it is used to describe how things are structured, not how they function. HTML actually stands for 'Hyper-Text Markup Language.' 

HTML is the first part of what we'll call the 'Web Trifecta.' The Web Trifecta is made up of:

1. **HTML**: The semantics of the site.
2. **CSS**: The presentation of the site.
3. **JavaScript**: The behavior of the site.

The real purpose of HTML is to dictate the *semantics* of the site, or what everything represents. For instace, do you have some paragraphs of text? Or a heading? Or a list of items? HTML describes the meaning and purpose of these items.

HTML accomplishes this by using *tags*. What's a tag? Well, it looks something like this:

```
<p>With great power, comes great responsibility.</p>
```

The ```<p>``` thing is what's known as a paragraph tag, and it says that everything inside it represents a paragraph of text. The tag is terminated by a tag has the same name, but has a ```/``` in front. In this case, the terminating tag is ```</p>```. So, this says we have a paragraph with the contents ```With great power, comes great responsibility.```

There are lots of tags, and HTML is basically just a collection of them. Most of this guide will be describing a bunch of tags and enforcing good style when writing HTML.
